Title: Analysis of 12nm FinFET Technology Using Sentaurus TCAD

This report presents a detailed analysis of 12nm FinFET technology utilizing Sentaurus TCAD (Technology Computer-Aided Design) software. 
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the performance, scalability, and feasibility of FinFET devices at the 12nm technology node. 
Through the use of Sentaurus Device and Sentaurus Process tools, key device parameters are simulated and optimized to assess their performance under different process variations.
The results demonstrate that FinFET technology provides significant advantages over traditional planar MOSFETs, including higher drive currents, reduced leakage currents, and enhanced overall performance.
These improvements make FinFET a strong candidate for scaling beyond current technology nodes.
